## Getting Started

Just open the project in Android Studio Arctic Fox(or above) and let Gradle do it's work.

## Contributing

It is recommended that you configure git hooks so that lint checks are automatically executed before
any commit. We prepared a script to set this up for you (run once per project):

```bash
config/pre-commit.sh
```
