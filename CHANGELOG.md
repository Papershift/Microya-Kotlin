<summary>Formatting Rules for Entries</summary>
Each entry should use the following format (Asana url is shortened to the last 4 digits):

```markdown
- Summarize what was changed in a single line.  
  Task: [6262](https://app.asana.com/0/0/1140415327756262/f) | PR: [#0](https://github.com/Papershift/Terminal-Android/pull/0) | Author: [Cihat Gündüz](https://github.com/Jeehut)
```

Note that at the end of the summary line, you need to add two whitespaces (`  `) for correct rendering on GitHub.

If needed, pluralize to `Tasks`, `PRs` or `Authors` and list multiple separated by `, `.
